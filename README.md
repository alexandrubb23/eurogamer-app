# Eurogamer shell script

This shell script is specifically designed to facilitate a seamless preview of both the Eurogamer API and Eurogamer Client. It automates the process of setting up and launching these applications, allowing you to quickly preview the full functionality of the Eurogamer platform.

# Using the Unified Setup Script

1. **Clone and Run Both Applications**: Simply execute the script, and it will handle the cloning, building, and running of both the **Eurogamer API** and **Eurogamer Client** applications. This is the easiest way to start both applications simultaneously.

2. **Run Individually**: If you prefer to run the applications individually, or if you need to perform custom configurations, please refer to the respective repositories for detailed instructions:

- [Eurogamer API Repository](https://github.com/alexandrubb23/eurogamer-api) - Contains instructions for setting up and running the API.
- [Eurogamer Client Repository](https://github.com/alexandrubb23/eurogamer-api) - Contains instructions for setting up and running the client application.

Ensure that you have all necessary prerequisites installed on your system, such as Git, Node.js, and any other dependencies mentioned in the individual repositories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandrubb23/eurogamer-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project

```bash
cd eurogamer-app
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
./script.sh
```

4. Run APP in preview mode:

```bash
http://localhost:3001/
```
